# 🛡️ NetSnoop
> A lightweight real-time Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) built with Python and Streamlit.

NetSnoop passively monitors your local network traffic and detects suspicious activity such as brute-force login attempts, unauthorized port scans, and access to critical ports (22, 23, 3389). It’s built to be fast, educational, and beginner-friendly.

## Detection Logic

- Ports monitored: `22 (SSH)`, `23 (Telnet)`, `3389 (RDP)`
- IPs flagged if repeated access attempts exceed threshold
- All packets logged in `logs/netsnoop_log.csv`
